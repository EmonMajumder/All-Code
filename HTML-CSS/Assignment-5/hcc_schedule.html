			<h1>History of the establishment of HCC starting from the coming of first man in Hamilton, Ohio</h1>
			Exhausted because, all week, he's come in early, stayed late, and put 
			in some serious hours. Proud because he knows he's done everything that's
			been asked of him, and more: he's dealt calmly and competently with every
			pressure and deadline that has been thrown at him.
			<p>A head pops around the door. It's Jo, a manager who Aidan works with 
			but doesn't report to directly. "I just wanted to say, I know you've been 
			really pushed this week, but well done. You've done a great job â€“ thank you." 
			She smiles before disappearing. Aidan sits back, pleased with the compliment.</p>
			<p>But then it hits him. This is the first time that anyone's said thank you 
			for anything, in the two years he's been with the team. And it wasn't even 
			his boss saying it! By the time Aidan is finally done, he knows that he needs 
			to look for a role in another section.</p>
			<p>In this article, we'll explore the importance of acknowledging and applauding 
			success. We'll examine some of the psychology behind reward and recognition, 
			and we'll outline a range of ways you can celebrate achievement.</p>
			<h3>Credit Where Credit's due.</h3>
			<p>We all want to feel confident and competent in our work. Much of that 
			confidence   will come from putting in the time and attention that's 
			needed to do a good job, being open to learning and development, and 
			having a healthy level of self awareness.</p>
			<p>But you, as a manager, also play a powerful part in your team members' 
			confidence. If you give "credit where credit's due," fairly and 
			appropriately, you will reinforce what your people know to be true, 
			and encourage them where they have doubts. However, if you rarely 
			acknowledge "a job well done," or constantly criticize them, there's 
			a risk that their motivation   will slip away. You might wonder why 
			you should bother to bolster your team members' self esteem. After 
			all, aren't they just doing what's expected of them? Sport shows us 
			that self assured teams   don't usually "rest on their laurels." 
			Instead, they want and expect more success, and go on performing well. 
			That pattern is just as clear in the workplace, so acknowledging and 
			celebrating achievement is part of Building an Effective Team.</p>
			<h3>Definitions</h3>
			<p>An American Psychological Association (APA) survey found that most 
			of the companies that its respondents worked for operated some kind of 
			recognition scheme, but that the rewards were aligned only rarely to 
			the organization's values or strategic priorities. More than a third 
			of the people surveyed had received no recognition in the previous 
			year, fewer than half said that recognition was provided fairly, and 
			only half felt valued by their employer.</p>
			<p>These schemes had failed badly. Imagine the waste of company effort 
			and resources, and the demoralizing effect on their employees! So, 
			to avoid making the same mistake, consider this carefully: what 
			would be right for your workplace?</p>
			<p>When we think of an achievement, we tend to imagine something 
			out of the ordinary, but it could be something as simple as 
			quietly consistent, good work. Some examples of clearly identifiable 
			achievements are hitting or exceeding a target, saving money, 
			delivering a project's next milestone, or getting sign off on a 
			whole project. But behaviors that are not so easy to measure 
			might also deserve recognition, such as pulling together as a 
			team to head off a crisis, or being consistently supportive 
			to new recruits.</p>
			<p>Similarly, what we mean by a celebration can vary, from private, 
			low-key and free, to public and fancy, with no expense spared! 
			Whatever you choose, be sure to tailor it to the situation.</p>
			<h3>Make It Really Count</h3>
			<p>The APA survey mentioned above also described a scenario that 
			might be painfully familiar from our personal lives. That is, a 
			reward or gift has no positive effect if the recipient doesn't 
			actually want or value it, no matter how much you've spent on it! 
			So, you'll need a deep understanding of your colleagues' preferences 
			and personalities, and the dynamics of the team, before you hold 
			a celebration. For example, if someone is an introvert  , he or 
			she might not </p>
			<p>want to be made the centre of attention. Instead, a quiet, 
			personal "thank you" could be all he needs, and he'll appreciate 
			it more. Similarly, don't offer him a bottle of wine if he 
			abstains, or throw an expensive away-day for the team just 
			as company pay rates are frozen. Some people can feel offended 
			or patronized by any overt appreciation of their work as, 
			to them, it seems to imply surprise. There might also be wider 
			cultural faux pas to avoid.</p>
			<p>So, you have a minefield to pick your way through! One way 
			to find out what your people will value is simply to ask them. 
			You can do this informally or through an employee engagement 
			or satisfaction survey. Beware of the effect on yourself, too. 
			"Going overboard" in your praise for everyday efforts might 
			make you appear out of touch   with the team's work. And 
			too-frequent thanks become meaningless, and lose their impact. 
			But it's worth persevering. As Bruna Martinuzzi writes  , 
			"There is a lovely Chinese quote that says, 'A bit of perfume 
			always clings to the hand that gives roses.' When we make 
			people feel great about themselves, paradoxically we elevate 
			ourselves to greatness as well."</p>
